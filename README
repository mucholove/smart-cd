What is it?
----------

  When I hit CD—I want to choose an option from my recent history. 
  I don't want to type out something every time.
  So...
  
  This is the begining of a program to allow me to choose where to go.
  
  It may be a dead-end because you can't actually change the directroy
  of a parent process (in this case Bash.)
  
  Furthermore—Bash does cache the directory.
  
  But...I may build a shell. Because...how hard could it be? :)
